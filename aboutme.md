### About me

Hi! I’m Jay — a curious mind with a passion for building, learning, and sharing.
I work in tech, where I spend most of my time solving problems, writing clean code, and exploring better ways to build scalable systems. Outside of work, I enjoy writing about the things I learn, from software development to productivity.

This blog is my space to document my thoughts, share insights, and connect with like-minded people. Thanks for stopping by — feel free to reach out or say hi! :)
